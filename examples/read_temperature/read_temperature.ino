/*
 * read_temperature.ino
 * Shows how to read a temperature from a temperature sensor with the SenseoUno.
 * This sketch uses the shield-based configuration instance which internally declares the analog input as A0 on the Arduino Uno board.
 * The shield-based instance also sets the NTC attributes as 10k resistor for both the 25 Â°C resistor and the serial resistor. The Beta is 4300.
 * PAY ATTENTION that these attributes may vary between two NTC resistors. It is possible to change the default attributes of the shield-based
 * instance. To do so the user can use the Senseo.setNTCvalues(NTCInitialResistor, serialResistor, Beta). Note that this method can be used on
 * the shield-based SenseoUno instance and on the SenseoUno empty instance. It can set and / or replace the NTC attributes.
 * 
 * In the sketch the user will see the two possibilities to read the value from the sensor with a SenseoUno instance. These two possibilities
 * use the same method. In each case there is a possibility to read the temperature as an int value or as a float value.
 * 
 * This sketch also uses the chronos of the SenseoUno library. There are two examples "single_chrono.ino" and "two_chronos.ino" if necessary.
 * There are two methods to read the temperature. We can also put the result in two different types : int and float.
 * In this sketch we will see how to use these two methods and display the four result possibilities on serial monitor.
